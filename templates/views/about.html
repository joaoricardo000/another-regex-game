  <h1 class="text-center">Another Regex Game</h1>
  <p>Heavly inspired by the many great regex games that already existed, like</p>
  <p><a href="http://regex.alf.nu" target="_blank">Regex Golf</a>&nbspand&nbsp<a href="https://regexcrossword.com/" target="_blank">Regex Crosswords</a></p>
  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>A game about finding patterns and creating expressions for words validation.</p>
  <h2>What?</h2>
  <p>You create regular expressions to analyze words letter by letter, and validates it based on rules.</p>
  <h2>...?</h2>
  <p>You teach your computer to analyse words! So much fun!</p>
  <h2>How can I learn more about regular expressions?</h2>
  <p>The internet is full of content for all skill level, just look for it. A good place to start<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" target="_blank"> is the wikipedia article.</a></p>
  <h2>How can I save and share a level?</h2>
  <p>You can't really save, just share the url.</p>
  <p>It's a good idea to share using #regexgame, so for the first time you will use a hashtag to store and index similar content for a quick search.</p>
  <h2>What are those strange words?</h2>
  <p>Those words are in portuguese.</p>
  <h2>I want to build my own regex game, with spanish words and hookers.</h2>
  <p>Great! All the source code is available on github, and it's quite easy to create your own levels and add your words.</p>
  <p>Please let me know if you do! (I would love to play some levels that I did not created)</p>
